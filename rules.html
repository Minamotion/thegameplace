                    <h1>RULES</h1>
                    <p>If your game contains the following your game will be banned:</p>
                    <div style="margin: auto; width: 750;text-align: left;color: red;">
                        <p> - Pornography or NSFW [How to avoid: Recheck the game you're about to send and seek NSFW]</p>
                        <p> - Racism [How to avoid: Make sure that in the game black people aren't treated as slaves or the n-word is mentioned]</p>
                        <p> - Higly offensive stuff [How to avoid: Use non-offensive words, It's just that simple]</p>
                        <p> - Copyright [How to avoid: Ask the original creator if the game has copyright or just make sure the game is not a fangame of Nintendo]</p>                        <p> - Cheap copy [How to avoid: OMG JUST MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL IN YOUR LIFE ASDFGHJKL]</p>
                        <p> - Hate [How to avoid: Make sure you don't have anything that represents hate to a person/company/etc. the 'No-Hate' thing won't work]</p>
                        <p> - Malware [How to avoid: Put the url in an antivirus check to seek malware, nobody wants their home address to be revealed, I'm talking to you SSSniperWolf]</p>
                        <p> - Death threats [How to avoid: Make sure you don't try to MURDER someone (from real life) in your game.]</p>
                        <p> - Absence of credits [How to avoid: GIVE CREDIT, DON'T TAKE THE GAME AND SAY ITS YOURS]</p>
                        <p> - Clickbait [How to avoid: Don't make the game be misleading by it's appearance, if the clickbait contains NSFW then it'll sure be banned]</p></div>
                        <br>
                        <p>If your game contains the above, It'll be taken down and replaced by another game (you'll be noticed) So don't even try to break the rules</p>
                        <p>but if your game is too good, the people like it, it's too famous idk, it'll sure have a special slot, you'll be notice when that happens</p>
                        <p>False reports will be ignored, if you are in love with the report button, then you sure need to go outside and touch some grass (NO GOOGLE!)</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Scratch projects are always welcome! (since they're expected to stay for too long!)</p>
